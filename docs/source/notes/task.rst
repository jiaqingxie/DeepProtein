What kind of task type does DeepProtein Consider
================================================

We have listed several tasks which are currently implemented in DeepProtein.

Protein Function Prediction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Protein function prediction involves determining the biological
roles and activities of proteins based on their sequences or structures. This process is crucial for
understanding cellular mechanisms and interactions, as a protein's function is often linked to its
sequence composition and the context of its cellular environment.

Protein Localization Prediction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Accurate localization predictions can enhance drug development
by informing target identification and improving therapeutic efficacy, particularly in treating diseases linked to protein mislocalization. Additionally, insights gained from localization predictions
facilitate the mapping of biological pathways, aiding in the identification of new therapeutic targets
and potential disease mechanisms.

Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Proteins are the essential functional units in human biology,
but they seldom operate in isolation; rather, they typically interact with one another to perform
various functions. Understanding protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for identifying
potential therapeutic targets for disease treatment. Traditionally, determining PPI activity requires
costly and time-consuming wet-lab experiments. PPI prediction seeks to forecast the activity of
these interactions based on the amino acid sequences of paired proteins.

Epitope Prediction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An epitope, also known as an antigenic determinant, is the region of a
pathogen that can be recognized by antibodies and cause an adaptive immune response. The epitope
prediction task is to distinguish the active and non-active sites from the antigen protein sequences.
Identifying the potential epitope is of primary importance in many clinical and biotechnologies,
such as vaccine design and antibody development, and for our general understanding of the immune
system [Du et al., 2023]. In epitope prediction, the machine learning model makes a binary
prediction for each amino acid residue. This is also known as residue-level classification.

Paratope Prediction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Antibodies, or immunoglobulins, are large, Y-shaped proteins that can
recognize and neutralize specific molecules on pathogens, known as antigens. They are crucial
components of the immune system and serve as valuable tools in research and diagnostics. The
paratope, also referred to as the antigen-binding site, is the region that specifically binds to the
epitope. While we have a general understanding of the hypervariable regions responsible for this
binding, accurately identifying the specific amino acids involved remains a challenge. This task
focuses on predicting which amino acids occupy the active positions of the antibody that interact
with the antigen. In paratope prediction, the machine learning model makes a binary prediction for
each amino acid residue. This is also known as residue-level classification


Antibody Developability Prediction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Immunogenicity, instability, self-association, high viscosity,
polyspecificity, and poor expression can hinder an antibody from being developed as a therapeutic
agent, making early identification of these issues crucial. The goal of antibody developability
prediction is to predict an antibody’s developability from its amino acid sequences. A fast and
reliable developability predictor can streamline antibody development by minimizing the need
for wet lab experiments, alerting chemists to potential efficacy and safety concerns, and guiding
necessary modifications. While previous methods have used 3D structures to create accurate
developability indices, acquiring 3D information is costly. Therefore, a machine learning approach
that calculates developability based solely on sequence data is highly advantageous.


CRISPR Repair Outcome Prediction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing technology that allows
for the precise deletion or modification of specific DNA regions within an organism. It operates
by utilizing a custom-designed guide RNA that binds to a target site upstream, which results in
a double-stranded DNA break facilitated by the Cas9 enzyme. The cell responds by activating
DNA repair mechanisms, such as non-homologous end joining, leading to a range of gene insertion
or deletion mutations (indels) of varying lengths and frequencies. This task aims to predict the
outcomes of these repair processes based on the DNA sequence. Gene editing marks a significant
advancement in the treatment of challenging diseases that conventional therapies struggle to
address, as demonstrated by the FDA’s recent approval of gene-edited T-cells for the treatment
of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Since many human genetic variants linked to diseases arise
from insertions and deletions, accurately predicting gene editing outcomes is essential for ensuring
treatment effectiveness and reducing the risk of unintended pathogenic mutations.
